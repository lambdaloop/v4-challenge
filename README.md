# UW V4 Neural Challenge

This is the repository for Team Rocket's solution to the [UW Neural Data Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/uwndc19), which scored 3rd place on the private leaderboard.

The code for fitting the solution, with annotations, may be found at the notebook [here](notebooks/fit neuron responses final.ipynb) .

Some exploration of the features that we are fitting and what it could mean for V4 may be found at [this notebook](notebooks/exploring model fits.ipynb) .
